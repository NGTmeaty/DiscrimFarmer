# DiscrimFarmer
Changes your discord username to the username of other people to force your discriminator to change, then stops once it hits the target number(s).

# Usage
1. Clone this repository
1. `$ go get`
1. `$ go build`
1. `./DiscrimFarmer -d <target discrims> -t <your discord token> -p <your discord password>`
1. Wait for a sweet discrim! Use `ctrl+c` to stop it running.

`<target discrims>` = list of discriminators separated by a comma, e.g. `1234,1337,0001`.
